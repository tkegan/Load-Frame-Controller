This documentation is dervived from examining a Labview program written in house at Bucknell University possibly using documentation from Tinius Olsen but the records of the program development have been lost.

Communication Settings:
	- baudrate: 19200
	- termination character: ASCII 13 i.e. \r

Command Language
	- "RC" Read Calibration or Read Range; An ASCII encoded intger is returned.
	- "RL" Read Load reported as an ASCII encode signed integer, "counts". The old code expects values from -30000 to 30000 over the range of the load cell (see lookup table). Perhaps a signed 16 bit integer (-32768 to 32767)? 
	- "RP" Read Extension reported in 0.001 mm i.e. a reading of 6087 is 6.087mm or 0.2396in
	- "WV#.#" Set Run Rate; Sets the rate at which the machine drives the platen in mm/min. Specify rate as one digit to the right of the decimal point with a minimum of 1.0 and maximum of 1500.0.
	- "WR" Start machine in motion Down
	- "WF" Start machine in motion Up
	- "WS" Stop machine motion
	- "WP" Zero Extension
	- "WZ" Zero Load


Range lookup... these values may be unique to Bucknell. The first column is the value returned by the RC command and the second column is the range in Newtons.
